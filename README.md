## Project Title
Website style guide
## Description
I made this webpage using HTML and CSS on 12.05.23 as part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer path. The purpose was to practise using different colours, fonts and text styles. As I had not yet learnt flexbox, I didn't know how to get all of the colour boxes the same size.
